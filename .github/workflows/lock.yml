            This repository is a fork of https://github.com/ppy/osu used for contribution purposes.
            Opening an issue on forks does not make sense. Thus, this repository accepts none.
            
            If you have any issues with some features I'm currently working on, please comment on the latest commit of the related branch (here) or Pull Request (on https://github.com/ppy/osu).
